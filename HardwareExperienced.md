This is the first step in the process towards automation!

### **Attention: If you do not have a Windows computer...**

Due to lack of developer support, we no longer officially support Mac and Linux. While it is still possible to set these programs up on Mac and Linux, you may need to debug the outdated build scripts.

If you are not willing to do that or you have no idea what this means, then stop. You will not be able to run these programs.

# (1) Select how far into automation you want to get

Select your level of automation 

| Microcontroller | Computer Controlled |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Den hosting | All microcontroller programs plus... |
| Day Skipping | Automated purple beam finder |
| Egg Hatchers | Den Hosting with stats!  |
| Unattended Shiny Hunts | Autonomous Shiny Hunts! |
| And more... | And more... |

# (2) Microcontroller Hardware

**No matter the level of automation you need, start here!**

_Buy the necessary items from A & B._

### A. Buy hardware under the column of what type of Switch you have.

| Switch | Switch Lite |
| --- | --- |
| Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example 0](https://www.amazon.com/Cmple-Pack-Male-5-Pin-Adapter/dp/B00A1PH0ZW), [example 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0GI68M)) | Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QJTX59H/)) |
|     | A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH)) |

### B. Buy *one* of the following Microcontrollers.

Select which column best exemplifies your experience and purchase that microcontroller.

| [Ardunio Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K) | [Teensy2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html) / [Teensy2.0++](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html) | [Pro Micro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BJNV1J3) |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| For beginners | For beginners | Experienced users |
| I am accustomed to Arduino | I want to easily add programs| I want to automate multiple switches, cheaply |
| I'm not experienced with electronics | I'm not experienced with electronics | I know my way around electronics |

### C. Verify you have the following

1. A Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adaptor (from step (2)A)
2. A microcontroller (from step (2)2B)
3. A USB hub or portable dock (if you have a Switch Lite!)

# (3) Additional Computer Controlled Hardware

_Buy the necessary items from A, B, C, & D._

### A. Serial UART board

Purchase *one* of the following serial boards

| Adafruit UART  | CP210x Board | 
| --- | --- |
| [CP210x controller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954) | [1 for $8](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072K3Z3TL) |
|   | [2 for $8](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6LLX19/) |
|   | [4 for $8](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T1XR9FT) |

### B. Serial Board Connections

Purchase *one* of the following Board Connections

| [Mini-Grabbers to Male Jumer Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M5GNY47) | [Soldless Hammer Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3662) | [Hammer Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2822) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Arduinos only need these** | N/A for Arduinos | N/A for Arduinos |
| Easiest option, but hard to find | Fairly easy to install. These must have a buldge on the short side. | Most difficult. Will require soldering. |
| No soldering. Best for beginners | Doesn't require soldering. | Requires soldering. Experienced only. |

### C. Capture Card

Purchase a Video capture card ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBRM7T))

### D. HDMI Cables

Purchase HDMI cable(s) if you don't own any

***Important:** You will need a fairly powerful computer to handle serial programs with video feedback. For a single Switch with video feedback, we recommend a quad core computer no older than 2015. If you want to run 4 Switches all with feedback, we recommend a modern 8-core computer. The computer must also be running 64-bit Windows, though plan to extend support to other operating systems in the future.*

> There are many ways to set this up with varying cost and difficulty. Here we will present some simple options that do not require soldering. If you are experienced with electronics, feel free to do your own thing.
